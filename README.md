# Star-Vs-the-Forces-of-Evil
This inspiration behind this game came from my twin daughters Samantha and Esmeralda. When I shared with them that I was going to make a game for this class
they thought it was really fun and cool. I didn't really know what I wanted to do. One of my daughters thought it would be cool make a game about a cartoon we
recently finished called Star vs the Forces of Evil. I did not know how I could make a game like this. I searched ideas online and found some pretty interesting 
maze games. I thought that would be a great game to make. Have a picture of the main character Star navigate through a maze to get to a destination. It would be simple
enought game that will push me and also let my daughters enjoy.
In this game Star will be able to find items which will give her points. Some items 
may dock points. Ultimatley her goal is to arrive at a destination with the most points possible.
